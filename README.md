## NBA - GSW Stats

A general goal of many statistical data analysis tasks is to relate the influence of one variable on another. Let's suppose three factors count in a game of basketball: FG ,TOV and AST based on the points for each player.

FG - Field Goal Attempts -A field goal made is credited to a player when an attempt is successful or when an official awards points for defensive basket interference or goal tending.A made field goal is credited when a player tips the ball into the basket.

TOV - Turnovers - A turnover is credited to an offensive player whose actions are directly responsible for losing ball possession to the opposing team prior to shooting. When a team has gained control of the ball or having become entitled to the ball does not put the ball in flight for a try at a field goal before an opponent gains control of the ball - then a turnover situation exists.A team turnover is credited when a team is in or entitled to possession of the ball, and a technical is called on the coach or the bench.

AST - Assists - an assist is attributed to a player who passes the ball to a teammate in a way that leads to a score by field goal, meaning that he or she was "assisting" in the basket.

We observe and collect data for 15 players in the team.The player with more points as well as better FG ,AST,TOV are ranked better in the team. We have taken only 3 stats agaisnt the points for a player in GSW team.
